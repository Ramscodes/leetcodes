/* This problem is finding out the next warmer temperature for a day
 * 		where temperatures of a day is given as an array
 * We can solve this problem by using two pointers concept but it takes more time
 * So here in the solution we used a stack to solve this problem
 * 		-> we will push the index of the current temperature into stack
 *		-> we will pop the stack if we find the temperature greater than previous temperature
