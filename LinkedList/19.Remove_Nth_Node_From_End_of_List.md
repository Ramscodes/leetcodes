[19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

# Intution and approach

1. This is a simple problem where we are given a linked list and a number(n) and we have to delete the nth node from the last.
2. Here we use the two pointer approaches to delete nth node. First pointer will be at the head and the other will be at the nth position from the head. When we iterate through the list until we second pointer reach last node, the first pointer will be at the nth node from last. we delete node the at the first pointer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity : O(n)
- Space complexity : O(1)

# Code
```
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode pointer1 = head;
        ListNode pointer2 = head;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
            pointer2 = pointer2.next;
        while(pointer2!=null){
            pointer2 = pointer2.next;
            prev = pointer1;
            pointer1 = pointer1.next;
        }
        if(prev == null) return pointer1.next;
        else prev.next = prev.next.next;
        return head;

    }
}
